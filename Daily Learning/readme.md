So today I started the day watching video [this]() video. Point I found useful 
1. solving problem randomly will give you a better view to understand all the possible way of solving the problem instead of learning topicwise which will already tell you which approach to choose.
2. Follow someone who is closer to your current stats
3. Upsolve problems
4. Instead of focusing on lots of algos learn few with deep understanding.
5. `learn when you are stuck`
6. `Make your weak point the strongest`

Sovled problem from 1.1 [Practice] Introduction to Competitive Programming
Contest 1: Very Basic Practice

```
1. It's better to use const when the value is constant
2. It is always better to use fixed when you use setprecision
3. Keep check for tle constrains
4. c/c++ division operator does floor division by default IF a and b are integers
5. \n instead of endl
6. isUpper , isAlpha , toLower , toUpper rather than ascii conversion
7. When value is not needed just the decision is needed log can be used for large values
```
