So today I started the day watching video [this]() video. Point I found useful

1. solving problem randomly will give you a better view to understand all the possible way of solving the problem instead of learning topicwise which will already tell you which approach to choose.
2. Follow someone who is closer to your current stats
3. Upsolve problems
4. Instead of focusing on lots of algos learn few with deep understanding.
5. `learn when you are stuck`
6. `Make your weak point the strongest`

Sovled problem from 1.1 [Practice] Introduction to Competitive Programming
Contest 1: Very Basic Practice

```
1. It's better to use const when the value is constant
2. It is always better to use fixed when you use setprecision
3. Keep check for tle constrains
4. c/c++ division operator does floor division by default IF a and b are integers
5. \n instead of endl
6. isUpper , isAlpha , toLower , toUpper rather than ascii conversion
7. When value is not needed just the decision is needed log can be used for large values
```

# 2 July 2023

sovled problem from 1.1 [Practice] Introduction to Competitive Programming
Contest 2: Loops Practice

```
1. Avoid using long long int when not needed
2. Keep check for tle constrains
3. Always check for lema in case of large constrains . Generate hadnwrittern solves and find the pattern from there
4. Use bitwise where possible for faster execution . For finding base 2 use log2
5. Keep in check for worst case . Calculate problems solution for worst case if mind is emtpy then do bruteforces then try to find pattern and then try to find the solution with efficient algo
6. Keep an eye for perfection
7. Use stl when possible
```

```

1.  Double and pow might give precision issues have to be careful to use them
2.  int can hold upto 2* 10^9 and long long int can hold upto 9*10^18
3.  Whenever using double loops always check for i , j are written properly

Well took the class of warm up 3 solved porblems for function and recursion.

1. 0 %2 = 0
2. Using dp in fibonacci reduces the time complexity from exponential to linear from 2 second to 2ms using dp

```cpp
// For getting total time elapsed in code
  cerr << "\n\n\n"<< (float)clock() / CLOCKS_PER_SEC * 1000 << " ms" << endl;
```

```cpp
// For fast io
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
```

`F. Eating Candies cf rating 1100` used suffix and prefix sum to solve the problem. The problem could be sovled using binary search as I could clearly see a monotonic function. But I was not able to implement it. I have to practice more on binary search. So chose to implement it using map to find out if a number occurs twice and as it was in linear time it got solved .

Currently sovling problems from cftracker.

```
!!!!!!!!!! Solved my first ever bit releated problem of rating 1300 !!!!!!!!!!
```

## [Maximal AND](https://codeforces.com/contest/1669/problem/H)

## [Answer the Queries](https://toph.co/p/answer-the-queries)

```
1. Solving approach
We have to keep an eye as there was no update operation needed so we can use a map to store the indices of a value so they are consistant.
Then just use the query to find the maximum value in range and pick out the indices of that value from the map and then we gotta check which indices are in the range to get the answer. which can be done by using uppre and lower bound

2. Mistakes
Also the thing that got me two wa  is this
>> if (l > r) return 0;

as the value could be negative I had to handle the case like this
>> if (l > r) return -1e9;

Also during building the tree it is better to store a single value rather than pair as it will be easier to handle the case of leaf node.

```

## Finding out the maximum value in a range using segment tree

The tree will be built in such a way that the root node will contain the maximum value in the range l to r .The query will return the maxium value in the range l to r .

```cpp
const ll N = 1e5 + 5;
int tree[4 * N];

// Here we are using 1 based indexing

void build(vector<int> arr, int current_node, int left_end, int right_end)
{
    // If the current node is a leaf node then store the value of the array at that index
    if (left_end == right_end)
        tree[current_node] = arr[left_end];

    else
    {
        int mid = (left_end + right_end) / 2;

        // THESE FORMULAS ARE FOR 1 BASED INDEXING
        int left_node = current_node * 2;
        int right_node = current_node * 2 + 1;

        build(arr, left_node, left_end, mid);                        // Build the left subtree
        build(arr, right_node, mid + 1, right_end);                  // Build the right subtree
        tree[current_node] = max(tree[left_node], tree[right_node]); // Update the current node
    }
}

// Query the segment tree for the max elements in range [l, r]
int query(int v, int tl, int tr, int l, int r)
{
    if (l > r) return -1e9;
    if (l == tl && r == tr)
        return tree[v];

    int tm = (tl + tr) / 2;
    return max(query(v * 2, tl, tm, l, min(r, tm)), query(v * 2 + 1, tm + 1, tr, max(l, tm + 1), r));
}
```

## Binary lifting
```
You are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of ith node. The root of the tree is node 0. Find the kth ancestor of a given node. 
```
### [Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-ancestor-of-a-tree-node/)

```
1. Solving approach
Well the first thing I could asume was that I could easily run a dfs to the parent bu again there ar Q queries so doing brute force will just give me cute tle . Now big bro Errichto came to enlighten me with his concept of binary lifting . 

19 -> 10011 so we can basically get 19 by adding up 16+2+1 . in the same way we can just do jumps in power of two to reach that level of anecstor now this wil always be possible because every number can be represented as a sum of power of two . 

So for that each bit that is turned on we will jump upto that level if that is possible. This idea of jumping from one node two another node in power of two is known as binary lifting.

So to do binary lifting we will have to pre process the tree and store the 2^i th ancestor of each node in a dp array . Then we can just jump to the kth ancestor of a node by using the dp array.


```

```cpp
class TreeAncestor {

    vector < vector <int>> up;
    vector < int > depth;
    int LOG  = 20;
public:
    TreeAncestor(int n, vector<int>& parent) {
         
          up = vector < vector <int >> (n , vector<int>(LOG));
          depth = vector <int>(n);
      
          parent[0] = 0;

        // finding the parent of node v and keeping it in the first indice
          for (int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) up[i][0] = parent[i];

          for (int i= 0 ; i < 100 ;i++)
            {
                for(int j = 1; j < n ; j++)
                    depth[j] = depth[parent[j]] +1;
            }

          for (int j  = 1 ; j  < LOG ; j++)
          {
              // counting rest of the possible jumps from that point in the power of 2 2^1 , 2^2 , 2^2
             
              for (int i = 0 ; i < n  ; i++){
                 up[i][j] = up [ up[i][j-1] ] [j-1];
               } 

          }

    }
  
    
    int getKthAncestor(int node, int k) {
        if (depth[node] < k) 
            return -1;

        for (int i = 0 ; i < LOG ;i++)
        {
            if (k &(1<<i))
                node = up[node][i];
        }

        return node;
    }
};
```
### TLE solution

[Kuriyama Mirai's Stones](https://codeforces.com/contest/433/submission/212149836) This submission has only one issue instead of passing reference to the vector in the function I was passing the whole vector which was basicaly copying the whole vector that took some additional time and gave me tle .

## XOR properties
```
1. XOR of a number with itself is 0
2. XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself
3. XOR is commutative and associative
4. XOR of a even number and successive odd number is always 1
5. As xor of two same number is zero this property can be used to find the missing number in an array if it is said that all number comes in pair except one
6. As xor from 1 to n can be found using constant time this property can be used to find xor in a given consecutive range
```
## Finding missing number from an array using xor
<details>
<summary> code </summary>

```cpp
// problem link https://www.spoj.com/problems/OLOLO/en/
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int32_t main()
{

    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    int n ,ans = 0, x = 0;
    
    cin >> n;

    // here x = 0 as xor of a number with 0 is the number itself

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> x;
        // finding xor of the array
        ans ^= x;
    }

    // why this ? its done in consant space and time complexity
    /*
    test case  :
        7
        2 4 6 4 2 2 2

        output : 6

        2^4^6^4^2^2^2 = 6

        we can get a better view if we sort them  just to understand it 

        2 2 2 2 4 4 6

        so we can see that 2 and 4 comes in pair but 6 is left alone so we can find it using xor

        in binary  they are 

        010
        010
        010
        010
        100
        100 --> upto this level we can see that they are coming in pair so we can just xor them and get 0
        110

    */

    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Finding XOR in range 0< l <= r <= 1e12
<details>
<summary> Code  </summary>
    
```cpp
// https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc121/tasks/abc121_d?lang=en
ll xor0toN(ll n)
{
    ll ans = 0;
    while (n >= 0 and n % 4 != 3)
    {
        ans ^= n;
        n--;
    }
    return ans;
}

ll xor_l_to_r(ll l, ll r)
{
    return ((l > 0 ? xor0toN(l - 1) : 0) ^ xor0toN(r));
}

/* the idea is to find xor from 0 to l-1 and xor from 0 to r and then xor them to get the xor from l to r

now the question is how to find xor from 0 to n in constant time as it can be in worst case 1e12
we can observe a pattern here that

we can observe an pattern here that

1^2 =1  3^4= 1  5^6 = 1 7^8 = 1

so it is basically XOR of an even and successive odd number is always 1 . now we can look a bit deeper

[(1^2 =1)  ^ (3^4= 1) = 0 ]  [(5^6 = 1) ^ (7^8 = 1) = 0] so for each 4 block we are getting 0 now we gotta find the last block which is not 4 
so for that we are iterating backword till we hit the end of the last block end because then we know when the block ends it will always be 0 . so we can just xor the last block with the block before it and get the answer

A detailed explanation can be found in 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-xor-of-numbers-from-the-range-l-r/

 */


```

```
1. To find sum in a range in an constant array we can use prefix sum array to find sum from l to r in constant time we can just do prefix[r] - prefix[l-1] to get the sum in that range the code must handle the case of l = 0 as prefix[-1] will give error

2. Passing reference to a function instead of passing the whole vector can save a lot of time and space as passing the whole vector will copy the whole vector and that will take a lot of time and space

3. Right shift operator can be used to divide a number by 2 as it is faster than dividing it by 2

4. Left shift operator can be used to multiply a number by 2 as it is faster than multiplying it by 2

5.Using next_permutation() we can find the next permutation of a string or a vector in lexicographically order

    log(n) base k = log(n) / log(k)
    floor(log(n) base k) + 1 = number of digits in n in base k

    why floor ? because log(n) base k can be a decimal number  wehen n is a power of k or logn is divisble by logk and we need to round it down to get the number of digits

We can optimize it a bit considering the fact that to calculate b! / a! we can just calculate (b * b-1 * b-2 ... a+1) [problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/869/submission/212370670)

### Given a string find out which characters occur odd times in the stirng without using any extra space

<details>
<summary> Solution </summary>

```
The idea is to use a bit mask to store the occurence of the characters in the string . We can use the fact that if we xor a number with itself it will become 0 . So each time a character occurs we can just toggle the bit and at the end we will be left with the bit mask of the characters that occured odd times in the string . We can then iterate over the string and check which characters have the bit mask set to 1 and print them out .

Well saw some videos about dynamic programming from luv and there he discussed about some problems. The main thing i captured was the defination of dp I can go top to bottom or I can go bottom to top. <br>
now in top to bottom we mainly use recursion and we try to decompose the main problem into some simmilar smaller problems. Now while we are claculating a problem we try to store that in a place so that the repetative work gets cancelled out.so that we can just focus on new things. 
consider it with an example.  Suppose you are a traveller and now are travelling to sikkim so for the first time when you will be going there you will obviously not know where to start from or how to get there so you ask a lot of queztion to everyone and finally create a map and list of info about the details and you complete a happy sikkim trip. 
now after a year you are agin going to sikkim. Now what will happen? If you are not an dummy traveller like me you have probably listed all the details about your previous trip and you are ready to go.  However if you did not then you would have to do the same processs again to gather information. So we memorize things or steps and try not to repeat same things twice. This thing in prohramming can be
 reffered as memoization that you memorize a certain things. 

Now you need to go to sikkim but you have again forgot the route. But you havent forgotten the full details you know how to go to shiliguri from dhaka. won't you use this information? just because you dont know the whole route?  Well you will and you should use as much previous knowledge as possible to do less things and do nee things only when required.  so once you arrive shiliguri you can just do a little bit of work to go to shiliguri. In such way we can use dynamic programming. So that's easy? He He easy to say easy to code, tough to understand the problem! best of luck!

## Random Facts

1. Bishop move is only valid if `(abs(x - i) == abs(y - j) && abs(y - j) > 0)` . In some cases this can be furthre modified to `(abs(x - i) == abs(y - j) && abs(y - j) >= 0)` which means that the current place of the bishop is also countable . Else it will be valid only if  a bishop is traveling from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2)
.This move is legal on an empty board if you have that: |x2−x1|=|y2−y1|>0 
You can find more about this from here https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1566115/formula-that-describes-the-movement-of-a-bishop-in-chess

 1. Each time a map is accessed randomly it alocates a new memory and stores the value there . So if we are using a map in a loop and we are not sure about the size of the map we can use a map.clear() to clear the map and free the memory . This will help us to avoid memory limit exceeded error . If we do ignore this we migh ecnounter a memory limit exceeded error . Like this 
 (https://codeforces.com/contest/1676/submission/213180728) . Here we are acessing 1 to 1e9 and each time we are checkign the value in the map which is also assigning 0 value in that position which is causing mle before it is giving us tle that why I was getting mle thanks to fatin for pointing it out.

## SQRT Decomposition

Well suppose there is a given array of size n and there can be two operation . 
1. Show the sum from l to r
2. Update value at a certain index 

So in such case the bruteforce way is to find the sum again and again which is not feasible in worst cases as in worst case it will be n^2 . Then we can solve it using segment tree . We can also do it by sqrt decomposition . What is this new term now ? <br>

So the idea is to divide the array into several pieces and keep track of the sum of each piece. So if we have an array of size 10 we can divide them into 3/4 part and keep track of the sum of each part . So if we want to find the sum from 1 to 5 we can just find the sum of the first part and the last part and then iterate over the middle part and add them up . So this will be sqrt(n) + sqrt(n) + sqrt(n) = 3sqrt(n) . So this is better than n^2 but not as good as segment tree . But the good thing is that it is easier to implement than segment tree . So if we have a problem where we need to find the sum of a range and update a value at a certain index we can use sqrt decomposition .

So in which size we will be partitioning the array ? Given size of n we can set each size to size of sqrt of n . in such way last part may not always be fully filled up unless the size is a square number. So we can just keep track of the size of the last part and then iterate over the last part to find the sum .

So how to update a value ? Well we can just find the part where the value is and then update the value in that part and then update the sum of that part .

So how to find the sum ? Well we will here have threee part  In the first part we will find th sum of the first part as the l may not always be the start of our partition . The middle part will 


## Custom Comparator 

Sometimes we may need to use custom comparator operator to do some sorting in such cases we can always use a custom comparator . Suppose we have a vector of pair and we want to sort it in a certain way . Then we can use a custom comparator to do that .

<details>
<summary>Code </summary>

```cpp

// Given n points in a two dimensional space, sort all the points in ascending order.

// (x1, y1) > (x2, y2) if and only if (x1 > x2) or (x1 == x2 and y1 < y2) 
bool cmp(pair<int, int> a, pair<int, int> b)
{
    return (a.first > b.first) or (a.first == b.first && a.second < b.second);
}

void solve()
{
   
    vector < pair < int , int >>  v;
    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), cmp);

}

## Maximum SubArray Sum (Kadanes Algorithm)

Kadanes algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a subarray . So suppose we have an array of size n and we want to find the maximum sum of a subarray . So we can just iterate over the array and keep track of the maximum sum of a subarray . So how to do that ? Well we can just iterate over the array and keep track of the maximum sum of a subarray . So if we are at a certain index we can just check if the sum of the previous subarray is greater than 0 or not . If it is greater than 0 then we can just add the current value to the sum and update the maximum sum . Else we can just update the sum to the current value . So in such way we can find the maximum sum of a subarray .

int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0;

        {
            sum = max(sum + nums[i] , nums[i]);

    2. Keep check for size of n to get a idea about the solving technique . If n is small then we can use brute force . If n is large then we can use some other technique . Today solved a cf Question https://codeforces.com/contest/550/submission/214458722 here I ignored the size of n and couldnot come up with a solution at first then seing at the size of n I could come up with with bitmask solution.
    3. In cc contest well try to implement bruteforce first and then try to optimize it . I was close but lacked the experience.

## Maximum  Sub-Array Sum (Prefix Sum)

Before I learned about how to find the maxiumum subarray sum using kadanes algorithm . Today I will talking about doing the same with the help of prefix sum . Now first of all what is prefix sum ?  in prefix sum we will be calculating the sum of all previous values in an array which is known as prefix array . Let us see an example below 

```
Main array = [ 1,2,3,-7,5,6,7]
Prefix Array = [ 1, 3, 6 , -1 ,4 ,10 , 17]
```

So once we are done calculating the prefix array which can be done in O(n) we will be iterating over the array and for each a[i] we will subtract the min till a[i-1] from a[i] and take the maximum from this result . Which is a greedy approach in solving the problem this can be done in O(n)  . We initialize the minimum with 0 . Lets look at an exapmle below .

```
Prefix Array = [ 1, 3, 6 , -1 ,4 ,10 , 17]
i = 6;
min until a[5] = -1;
a[6] = 17
a[i] - in until a[i-1]
= 17 - (-1)
= 18 

```
So the answer will be 18  and we can get the answer by adding `5+6+7 = 18`

<summary>Code</summary>

```cpp

ll maximumSubArraySum(vector<ll> prefix)
{

    ll ans = LLONG_MIN;
    ll curr_min = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < prefix.size(); i++)
    {
        ans = max(ans, prefix[i] - curr_min);
        curr_min = min(curr_min, prefix[i]);
    }

    return ans;
}
